# 1D Convolutional Neural Network for Time Series Classification

This repository presents a **One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)** implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras** for **time series classification**.  


## Datasets
The proposed 1D CNN architecture is suitable for a wide range of time series classification tasks, including but not limited to:
- Signal classification (accelerometer, gyroscope, EEG, ECG)
- Signal monitoring 
- Temporal pattern recognition
